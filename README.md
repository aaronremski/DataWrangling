# Data Wrangling Techniques

This repository is a culmination of the Data Wrangling techniques I've learned through Udacity and is in no way an authoritative resource. Rather, it'll become a personal library.

## Gather

Data provided as is.

## Assess

Examples:
  1. Zip code has wrong datatype
  2. Contact info needs separating & formating
  3. Totals wrong
  4. Missing records
  5. Consolidation of data
  6. etc.

## Clean
Notebook: **cleaning-student.ipynb, .py should also be present as a clone** <br/>
Data: **data/patients.csv, data/adverse_reactions.csv, data/treatments.csv**

The culmination of gathering & assessing data. The data contains a mock pharmeceutical study with ~400 patients who received 2 medications. One is insulin for diabetes treatment, administered intravenously. The other is insulin that can be taken with a pill. It's a study to determine the efficacy of the oral insulin.
